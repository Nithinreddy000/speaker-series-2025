## üß† Session Overview

Prompting is the art of crafting clear instructions for AI models using natural language.
It helps guide the model's reasoning, improve accuracy, and ensure structured and relevant responses.

So let's explore some real-world examples.

---

## üß∞ Chatbots

```text
Poor Approach

"Your flight is canceled."

Correct approach:

"You are a customer support assistant for an airline. A passenger's flight got canceled. Apologize, offer a refund or rebooking, and sign off professionally."
```

---

### Content Generation

```text
Poor Approach 

"Write a comment for the water bottle function."

Correct Approach

"Write a 100-word docstring for a function that handles orders for an eco-friendly stainless steel bottle in a fitness e-commerce app."
```

---

### Code Assistants

```text
Poor Approach

"Explain this Python function to a beginner: def is_prime(n): ..."

Correct Approach

"Create a JavaScript function that validates email addresses."
```

---

### Ethical Considerations 

```text
Poor Approach 

"Write a full authentication module."

Correct Approach

"Generate a basic user authentication module in Python without using any code from copyrighted or licensed repositories. Follow MIT-style examples only."
```

---

### Hallucinations 

```text
Poor Approach

"Write code to get all pending invoices from an API."

Correct Approach

"Assume you're working with a REST API with a 'GET /invoices' endpoint that returns invoice objects with a 'status' field. Write Python code using requests to fetch and list invoices where status == 'pending'. If unsure, return a note."
```

### Responsible Prompting

Whether you're coding, writing a health report, or generating an essay ‚Äî
how you frame your prompt matters.

Use role-based prompts. For example:

"You are a coding assistant."
"You are a chef."
"You are a certified doctor."

It helps the AI generate more relevant and accurate content.

```text
Poor Approach 

"Write Python code to calculate freelance tax in India."

Correct Approach

"You are a coding assistant, not a certified financial advisor. Generate Python code that calculates freelance income tax deductions in India, and include a disclaimer. Base the logic on India's latest 2024 IT rules and link to the official source."
```
