## 🧠 Session Overview

Semantic Search goes beyond keywords — it understands **meaning**.  
In this session, we’ll explore how **embeddings** and **vector databases** enable this understanding.

You’ll learn how to:
- Convert text into numerical representations (embeddings)
- Store and search them efficiently in a vector database
- Build a mini **semantic search engine** powered by AI with Azure Ai Services

We’ll also discuss how this technology powers **ChatGPT**, **Notion AI**, and **Copilot** behind the scenes.

---

## 🔍 What We’ll Learn Today

1. **Why keyword search fails** – the gap between text and meaning  
2. **How embeddings work** – turning language into math  
3. **What vector databases do** – finding meaning through similarity search  
4. **Hands-on demo:** Build a semantic search using Azure Ai Services
5. **Applications:** How enterprises use it for RAG, chatbots, and document search

## Step 10

Click create and then click on Azure Open ai

![| 100x100](./images/9.png)

## Step 11

Fill the basic config details as follows and instance name can be names as you prefer

![| 100x100](./images/10.png)

## Step 12

Skip the network and tags tabs by clicking next and then click on create at the end after review and wait for deployment to be successful.

## Step 13 

Click on go to resource and then scroll down to click on "Explore Azure Ai Foundry Portal".

![| 100x100](./images/12.png)

## Step 14

Go to Deployments tab in the new Azure ai foundry side nav and then click on Deploy and then on Deploy Base model

![| 100x100](./images/13.png)

## Step 15

Search for text-embedding-3-small model in the avaiable models of open ai for creating embeddings and then click on create.

## Step 16

Click on Deploy with default config info

![| 100x100](./images/15.png)

## Step 17

you will see this page of info regarding for our open ai deployment. please keep a note of deployment name and the model name and also copy the open ai key.

## Step 18 

Click on the below link to access and download the json file from my github.

---

## Step 19

Make sure you have downloaded the postman desktop app
open postman and then click import-> files ->import the json file u just downloaded.

## Step 10

Click on Each one of the Request and click send one by one.

## Additional Steps if facing error with region validation

search for "Subscriptions" in search bar

![| 100x100](./images/16.png)

Click Azure for Students and inside settings click policies

![| 100x100](./images/17.png)  

Expand option Authoring and then click on Assignments to find the option " Allowed resource deployment regions"

![| 100x100](./images/18.png)

In the parameter value column you will find the avalaible deployment regions if facing issues use the allowed regions from policies while creating Ai search and Open ai Resources
